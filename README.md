PythonNFLStatScraper
====================
  This is a quick scraper I am trying to put together to scrape pretty specific stats from NFL.com.  It took me a while to find 
 the proper tools to do this, but I found a module by BurntSushi called nflgame that allows me to easily pull stats from nfl.com.
 This is one of my first forays into Python, so comments are welcome.
